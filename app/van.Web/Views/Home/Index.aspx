    <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
<p>What is Virtual ALT.NET (VAN)?&nbsp; In this blog I’m going to explain the purpose
of VAN.&nbsp; The history of VAN is very short.&nbsp; Another alt.netter <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers">Chad Myers</a> and<a href="http://www.zachariahyoung.com"> I </a>started
meeting once a week to do some pair programming.&nbsp; I had met Chad at the <a href="http://www.austincodecamp.com/">Austin Code Camp 2008</a> conference and
he offered to help anyone willing to learn about .Net.&nbsp; After the meeting, I
went up to him and introduced myself and said I would love to pair program with
him.&nbsp; Since I live in the great state of Arkansas, it is hard to pair up with
any alt.netters.&nbsp; There really isn’t any here.&nbsp; My plan was to attend the Code
Camp and learn as much as I could.&nbsp; Being able to pair program with someone like
Chad was a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>What started out as two people pair programming, then turned into just a few
alt.netters talking about alt.net.&nbsp; Now we have 40 to 50 people from all over
the world attending our VAN meetings.&nbsp; We typically meet once a week and
announce the meeting via twitter or by a blog post by Chad or myself.&nbsp; We have
had various influential alt.netters speak to at our meetings.&nbsp; For example,
Jeremy D Miller and Scott Bellware have both spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><h2>Purpose</h2></p>
<p>Since&nbsp;technology has improved so much, it is really easy to hold virtual
meetings.&nbsp; With this ease, meetings can bring together all kinds of people from
all over the world.&nbsp; These people can include influencers, learners and
speakers.&nbsp; As these people come together, a social aspect evolves and as a
result people start learning.&nbsp; Through this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment">virtual
environment for learning</a> a learning philosophy is created call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism">social
constructionist</a>. This basically means that people can learn from each other
socially and knowledge is constructed.&nbsp; Part of what makes these meetings so
amazing is that people can ask questions in real time.&nbsp; I would say that the
alt.net community is pretty small compared to others.&nbsp; If you are reading and
learning on your own, sometimes it would be nice just to ask your questions.&nbsp; In
my case the closest people I know that understand alt.net are hundreds of miles
away.&nbsp; To connect to these people it really requires traveling around to
different metro area.&nbsp; The really cool part about all this is that&nbsp;people&nbsp;in
other countries trying to learn about alt.net, who may never have the chance to
ask the difficult questions, can.&nbsp; Really the purpose of these VAN meetings is
to provide anyone in the world the opportunity to learn more about alt.net
virtually.</p>
<p><h2>The VAN meeting</h2></p>
<p>The requirements for hosting a virtual alt.net meeting are really simple.&nbsp; It
just requires two people talking about alt.net virtually.&nbsp; It could be just
a&nbsp;basic Skype call.&nbsp; We have used Skype and Shareview before.&nbsp; The second piece
is&nbsp;the ability for screen sharing.&nbsp; This is needed to review and share
code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For bigger groups, we have been using a LiveMeeting account that is provided
to us from INETA.&nbsp; We have had a really good experience with this tool.&nbsp; One
cool feature is that it gives us the ability&nbsp;to record the meetings.&nbsp; One thing
I think that it is missing is a group chat function.</p>
<p>The format for the meetings have mostly been the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space
Technology</a> method.&nbsp; Using this method, the agenda is created at the start of
the meeting.&nbsp; Within LiveMeeting you can use the whiteboard to post the item or
items you want to talk about.&nbsp; Also, it is a good idea to appoint a
facilitator. <br>
